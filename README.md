# Super-Mario_Bros-AI
This project implements a reinforcement learning algorithm using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) policy 
to train an AI agent to play Super Mario Bros inside an OpenAI gym environment. 
The model was further improved through additional training using curriculum learning, where the agent 
was trained on Mario levels of varying difficulties to maximize reward. Gradually increasing in difficulty, 
this approach allowed the agent to make optimal decisions and achieve higher scores.
